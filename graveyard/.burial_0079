  "epitaph": "Seeking passage home on the Festival\u2019s rush,\nYou parsed the captcha and waited to crush\nThe wall of the server. But time is a train\nThat departs the station and never again\nReturns for the passenger, quiet or loud.\nThe tickets are sold out; your script is not proud.\nHere lies the Selenium, stopped in its run,\nRest in peace, `return None`.",
