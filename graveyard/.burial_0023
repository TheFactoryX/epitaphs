  "epitaph": "Here lies the widget that dragged and dropped the world,\nA symphony of progress bars, beautifully unfurled.\nIt shepherded thirty thousand stars through the dark,\nResuming broken chunks with a patient spark.\nThough jQuery fades and the branch is now quiet,\nIts legacy uploads, a silent digital diet.\nThe form is submitted, the callback is null.",
