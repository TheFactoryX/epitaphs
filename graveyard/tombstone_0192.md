## Epitaph

You wrote the holy script in a native tongue,
A testament to power, strictly unsung.
Avoiding the seduction of Python or Go,
You showed us the path that the shell-masters know.
Now the issues are closed and the commits have ceased,
No forks shall disturb this eternal peace.

Rest in `> /dev/null`.
