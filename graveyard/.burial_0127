  "epitaph": "It gathered five thousand stars in the lonely firmament,\nA bridge for divided cursors to meet and mend.\nBut the conflicts grew too complex to resolve,\nAnd the sockets closed on the twelfth of September.\nNo \"Conflict-Free\" transform could save this synchrony,\nAs ten winters freeze the sockets of the weaver.\nGone to the great buffer in the sky, now and always.\nRest in /dev/null.",
