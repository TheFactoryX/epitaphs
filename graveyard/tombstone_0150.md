## Epitaph

You lived as the liar, the actor, the fake,
Where Sebastian’s rigorous tests were at stake.
The props were all set, and the doubles aligned,
But the parent project had left you behind.
No Issues shall stir you, no Pull Requests come,
Your stage is now dark in the repository slum.
Four thousand nine stars watch you quietly rust,
Mocking the living, mocking the dust.
Rest in `return null;`.
