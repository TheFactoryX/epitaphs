## Epitaph

Here rests the Slate, in monochrome and grey,
Who taught the API to speak and not to sway.
Thirty-six thousand stars once lit your scroll,
Now the green commits have ceased to unroll.
The static pages serve the silent dust,
Your elegance abandoned by the restless.
Close the issue, let the static render null,
Rest in peace within /dev/null.
