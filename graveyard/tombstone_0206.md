## Epitaph

Here lies `the-little-prover/j-bob`,
A Scheme to prove theorems, not to sob.
Though stars number four hundred and thirty-six,
Time halts all functions, halts all tricks.
Eight years of logic, now left in the cold,
The definitions are stiff, the arguments old.
Check your theorems at the door, don't wait for the call,
Rest in /dev/null, parentheses and all.
