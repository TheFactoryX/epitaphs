  "epitaph": "It saw the world through bounding boxes and masks,\nTraining the eyes of silicon to dream.\nA library of vision, where FAIR\u2019s research asks,\nIf machines could perceive what the data stream.\nThough archived in silence, the RetinaNet fades,\nTwenty-six thousand stars look down in the gloom.\nThe framework is halted, the iteration delays,\n`Rest in /dev/null`, inside the tomb.",
