## Epitaph

Here lies Michi4’s grand design,
To weave inboxes from the ether,
Selenium’s ghost at the head of the line,
Weaving accounts no user could befriend.
Seventy stars watched the cloak and the dagger,
Now the automation sleeps in the static,
Undisturbed by the captchas we never could solve.
Rest in /dev/null.
