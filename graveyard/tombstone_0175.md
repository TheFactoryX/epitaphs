## Epitaph

Here lies **DogPush**, a keeper of the peace,
Who turned Datadog’s noise into a YAML release.
With hammer in hand, it stilled every chime,
But eight winters of silence have run out of time.
No language remains where the monitors dwell,
Just stars gathering dust in a digital shell.
Rest in /dev/null, where alerts are no more.
