  "epitaph": "Born in autumn, a guide for the AI,\nWith twenty-three thousand stars in your eye.\nYou taught us the syntax, the prompt, and the code,\nBefore growing silent on November's road.\nNo language remains, just the ghost of the text,\nArchived at last, put to final rest.\nSo pull the repo and wipe the drive clean,\nAnd sleep in the void of `/dev/null`.",
