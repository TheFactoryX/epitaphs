## Epitaph

It was forged in TypeScript fire to ride the Flutter wave,
A high-performance renderer, a standard so brave.
Two years of light, then the commits went slow,
Leaving nearly five thousand stars aglow.
Silent for a thousand days, the issues now still,
Unarchived and waiting, against logic and will.
The web page loads heavy, the dream is now dull,
Rest in peace, Kraken, return to `/dev/null`.
