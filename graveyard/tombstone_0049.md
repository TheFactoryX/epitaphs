## Epitaph

Born in the chill of late November, nineteen,
A Vue composition of pages and dreams.
You gathered your stars, seventy-two in the dark,
Now static, unmoved, like a cold, hard remark.
The cross-platform promise has faded away,
Leaving only silence where commits used to play.
Rest in /dev/null.
