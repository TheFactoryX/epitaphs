  "epitaph": "For thirty thousand stars, you pulled the melody from the ether,\nA bridge of JavaScript where the music was freer.\nEight years of rhythm, till the lawyers drew near,\nSilencing the node that we held so dear.\nThough the API sleeps and the interface is gray,\nThe songs you unlocked refuse to fade away.\nRest in `return null;`",
