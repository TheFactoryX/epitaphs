## Epitaph

Beneath the static script of TypeScript stars,
You drifted without anchor, description, or name.
For five hundred and twenty days, the battle was yours,
Before the commit log grew forever silent and tame.
Two years of quiet in the digital haze,
A phantom architecture of abandoned days.
Rest in `dev/null`.
