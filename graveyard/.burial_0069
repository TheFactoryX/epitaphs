  "epitaph": "Four thousand stars looked down on chains of sand,\nTo ask the null-value for its trembling hand.\nThough born in HTML, your heart was JS,\nNow archived in silence, laid to rest.\nThe optional path is traveled no more,\nJust nested echoes of a closed loop door.\nRest in peace, sweet syntax, your thread is cut,\nRest in peace and merge into /dev/null.",
