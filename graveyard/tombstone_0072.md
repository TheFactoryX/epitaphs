## Epitaph

It stood as a proxy against the slow crawl of the web,
Splitting the heavy streams into fragments of speed.
Twenty-four thousand stars watched it dismantle the wait,
Before the connection was closed and the commits met their fate.
Though the Java dust settles on connections now gone,
The bytes it compiled for us linger on.
Rest in /dev/null.
