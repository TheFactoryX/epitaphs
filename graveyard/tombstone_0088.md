## Epitaph

Once you bundled the source, compiling the node,
Transforming our JavaScript into a perfect binary code.
But the issues grew stale and the commits grew slow,
Leaving twenty-four thousand stars nowhere to go.
So close the terminal window on this glorious feat,
And sleep in the silence, no longer `pkg`.

Rest in /dev/null.
