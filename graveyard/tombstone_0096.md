## Epitaph

Here lies `webgems`, a radiant Vue,
A curated light for the creative few.
It shone for five thousand stars, bright and brief,
Before time claimed the gems and the belief.
The `devcord` chat is a ghost in the shell,
`Nuxt` is slumbering, casting its spell.
The PR is closed, the commit is nil,
Rest in peace in `/dev/null`.
