  "epitaph": "Born of a symphony in a coffee script key,\nYou promised the hackable world to the free.\nSixty thousand stars watched the Electron decay,\nAs the Sublime clone faded to silent gray.\nFour thousand days of a beautiful, tangled regime,\nNow archived in darkness\u2014a closed editor\u2019s dream.\nCommit your changes to the void, where lost data runs null,\nRest in /dev/null, sweet atom, a beautiful hull.",
