## Epitaph

Here lies the grand ambition of the steel cloud,
A galaxy of microservices, containerized and proud.
Twenty-four thousand stars watched the .NET Core bloom,
Before the Azure winds swept it to a new repository's tomb.
The DDD patterns sleep, the Docker images still,
Orchestrated by silence on the Kubernetes hill.
Rest in /dev/null.
