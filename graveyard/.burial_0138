  "epitaph": "In the season of cold Decembers, 1100101/Automatic was spun,\nA C-engine to harvest the feed, before the seeding was done.\nFor fourteen years it filtered the static, the torrent, the noise,\nBut now the pipe is broken, and the RSS voice is stilled.\nSix days only since the last commit, the silence settles deep,\nNo more torrents to pull, only entropy left to keep.\nFarewell, keen observer of the byte,\nRest in /dev/null, dream in white.",
