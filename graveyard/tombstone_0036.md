## Epitaph

A titan’s list of twenty-four thousand stars,
Cataloging digital worlds from golden years.
Now the final push is blocked, the book is barred,
Leaving only ghosts of engines and old gears.
Silent one hundred and forty days and more,
A map to nowhere, locked behind the door.
Rest in /dev/null.
