## Epitaph

You patched the broken integrity of the core,
A hex-decimal suture for the modified shell.
For two thousand days, the silent errors wore
Your name as eighty-eight stars bid farewell.
Now the checksums drift and the files grow old,
Unchanged by the hand that the hacks foretold.
Rest in /dev/null.
