## Epitaph

A piping hot stream in the winter of twenty-fourteen,
With nearly five thousand stars watching the blend.
But the Gulp ran dry and theWebpack grew mean,
Leaving the asset pipeline frozen at the bitter end.
No sprites will refresh, and the browsers cease sync,
Your config lies dormant, too heavy to lift.
Committed to memory, gone in a blink,
Rest in peace in `node_modules/.bin`.
