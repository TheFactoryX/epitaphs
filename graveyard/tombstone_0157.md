## Epitaph

Here lies `Alfred1984/interesting-python`,
A digital gardener who watched the web spin.
Four thousand stars shone on your crawlers and graphs,
Before the silence set in on your paths.
Through Jupyter cells you sought the data's truth,
A fleeting spark in the endless quest for proof.
Now the servers are cold, and the notebooks are closed,
In the repository of ghosts, your kernel is froze.
Rest in /dev/null.
