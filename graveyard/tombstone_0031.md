## Epitaph

Once you bridged the void for thirty-three thousand stars,
A joyful `AFHTTPRequestOperation` amidst the bits.
But the Swift wind blew cold, and the console now bars
Your verbose syntax; the codebase finally quits.
Silence has reigned for a thousand and eleven days,
Archived in amber, a glorious fossil of old.
No more patches, no merges, to end the malaise—
Rest in `dev/null`, where the broken and bold unfold.
