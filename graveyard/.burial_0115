  "epitaph": "Once you taught the silicon to see, through masks and eyes of code,\nFairchild of vision, where the future\u2019s bright roads showed.\nBut time moves faster than the frame rate allows,\nAnd even the sharpest RetinaNet must eventually close.\nYour legacy is weighted, your training is done,\nFade into the layers where the dark is gone.\nRest in peace in /dev/null.",
