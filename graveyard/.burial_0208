  "epitaph": "It watched the registry for a decade, diligent and bright,\nPulling fresh images through the silence of the night.\nWith forty thousand stars, it kept the rust away,\nBut even stalwart guards must cease their endless fray.\nNow the container stands still, the update script is done,\nNo new deployments rising like a morning sun.\nThe stacks are frozen in their final, brittle shell,\nRest in peace in `/dev/null`, where dormant processes dwell.",
