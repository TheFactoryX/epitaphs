## Epitaph

We type `:q` to sever the connection,
But fingers falter in the reflection.
A Ruby ghost haunts the buffer’s edge,
Undoing the final window’s hedge.
Eleven years of reopening the past,
At last, the closing itself was fast.
Rest in `:bwipeout`.

---

**Description:** Undo a :quit -- reopen the last window you closed

**Topics:** buffer, restore, vim-plugins
