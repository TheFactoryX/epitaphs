## Epitaph

Born in the spring of the LLM explosion,
A promise of autonomy in every line.
To assemble and dream within the browser’s grip,
Now the Next.js server has ceased to hum.
It sleeps silently in the archive’s cold tomb,
A star that burned bright for two fleeting years.
Rest in `if (false)`.
