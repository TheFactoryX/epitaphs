## Epitaph

Beneath the silicon sky, where x86 secrets sleep,
A rusted core of safety that the architects could keep.
One hundred and forty stars watched the secure VM rise,
Before the hypervisor closed its tired eyes.
Seven hundred days of silence, a static void so deep,
For the Secure Service Module, now an abstract heap.

Rest in /dev/null.
