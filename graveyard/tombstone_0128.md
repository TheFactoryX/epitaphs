## Epitaph

Born in a January when the web was young,
You taught the DOM to dance with two-way binds.
Though the letter 'J' has dropped from your tongue,
Fifty-eight thousand stars remain, resigned.
The migration paths are dust, the versions sealed,
A legacy of curly braces, left behind.
Rest in /dev/null.
