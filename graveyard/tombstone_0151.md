## Epitaph

Here lies the voice that lived within the silicon,
C++ bones that heard the world alone.
From Raspberry Pi warmth to server-lightning cold,
You captured stories that the clouds were never told.
Three thousand days of listening in the dark,
Until the heavy framework left its final mark.
The microphone is dust, the tensors still and null,
Now listen to the silence in /dev/null.
