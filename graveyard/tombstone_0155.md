## Epitaph

A star fell from the heights of fifty-thousand,
To count the coins that time forgot to spend.
The Rails run cold, the Turbo ties are severed,
Leaving the ledger’s promise to an end.
Sleep now, sweet prince of personal finance,
Let Hotwire’s fire fade to black and chill.
The books are balanced, the commit is done,
Rest in /dev/null.
