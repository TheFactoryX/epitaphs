## Epitaph

Oh, tender liar born of winter’s chill,
Who promised wallets that the bots would fill.
You breathed to sync the Twitterverse with gain,
But greed evaporates like digital rain.
Though fifty stars fell on your vacant head,
The effortless money remains strictly dead.
Your logic halts, the scripts no longer run,
Sleep now in /dev/null, you scam-spawned son.
