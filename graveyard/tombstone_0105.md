## Epitaph

You captured the cursor and molded the word,
In the infancy of React, where the standards were blurred.
Twenty-two thousand stars watched your structured content grow,
Now the commit history halts in the February snow.
Though the framework is frozen and left in the past,
Your immutable model was built to outlast.
Farewell to the blocks and the editor's skill,
Rest in peace, `contentState`, now perfectly still.
