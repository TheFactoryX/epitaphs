  "epitaph": "Here lies the page, asymmetric and bold,\nA decade of typesmithing, perfectly told.\nNo more shall the compile log brighten the screen,\nThe fonts are unrendered, the stylesheet unseen.\nThough the undergraduate years have flown past,\nYour XeTeX syntax was built to outlast.\nSo shift-delete the dreams of the coder in school,\nAnd `rm -rf` the rest of the formatting rule.",
