## Epitaph

It saw the world through bounding boxes and masks,
Training the eyes of silicon to dream.
A library of vision, where FAIR’s research asks,
If machines could perceive what the data stream.
Though archived in silence, the RetinaNet fades,
Twenty-six thousand stars look down in the gloom.
The framework is halted, the iteration delays,
`Rest in /dev/null`, inside the tomb.
