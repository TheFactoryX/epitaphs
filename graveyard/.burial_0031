  "epitaph": "Once you bridged the void for thirty-three thousand stars,\nA joyful `AFHTTPRequestOperation` amidst the bits.\nBut the Swift wind blew cold, and the console now bars\nYour verbose syntax; the codebase finally quits.\nSilence has reigned for a thousand and eleven days,\nArchived in amber, a glorious fossil of old.\nNo more patches, no merges, to end the malaise\u2014\nRest in `dev/null`, where the broken and bold unfold.",
