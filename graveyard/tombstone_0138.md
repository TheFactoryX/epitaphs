## Epitaph

In the season of cold Decembers, 1100101/Automatic was spun,
A C-engine to harvest the feed, before the seeding was done.
For fourteen years it filtered the static, the torrent, the noise,
But now the pipe is broken, and the RSS voice is stilled.
Six days only since the last commit, the silence settles deep,
No more torrents to pull, only entropy left to keep.
Farewell, keen observer of the byte,
Rest in /dev/null, dream in white.
