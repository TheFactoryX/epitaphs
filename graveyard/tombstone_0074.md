## Epitaph

A gentle pane of Java glass that rose from bottom-sheets,
You guided four thousand hands through Android’s winding streets.
Though silence claims the code you wrote and halts the steady stream,
The starmark on your grave remains, a half-forgotten dream.
No Kotlin breath will wake this screen, the thread is cut in two,
Sleep now, `DialogPlus`, your final render is through.
