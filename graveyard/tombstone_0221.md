## Epitaph

Sixty-six stars blinked in the dark of December,
A Python script written to decipher.
But silence fell swift with the thaw of the snow,
Leaving "DiaPer" with nothing to show.
No topics to tag it, no purpose to tell,
Unarchived, unwritten, and silent as well.
A promise of code that would never fulfill,
Rest in /dev/null.
