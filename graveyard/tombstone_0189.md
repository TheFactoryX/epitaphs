## Epitaph

For ten long years you kept the watch, undying,
A silent sentinel beneath the stacks of Go.
With endless hope you pulled the base image, trying
To patch the holes that time allowed to grow.
But even guardians must close their weary eyes,
Left archived here beneath the frozen skies.
No more commits, no more notifications to send.
Rest in peace, `RuntimeError`. Update your end.
