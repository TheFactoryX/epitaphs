## Epitaph

Here lies the star that burst in bloom,
A spiral path that fills the room.
Written in the old tongue’s rhymes,
It lived a thousand digital times.
Though stars count near five thousand strong,
CoreAnimation’s breath is gone.
Commits have frozen, syntax grows cold,
A graceful menu, ancient and old.
Rest in /dev/null.
