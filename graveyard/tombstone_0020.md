## Epitaph

Here lies the debugger, the scalpel, the wall,
The master of IL who disassembled it all.
Twenty-eight thousand stars watched you break the binary chain,
Before the last commit left you frozen in pain.
No longer to patch or crack or inspect,
You drift into bit-rot, cold and correct.

Rest in /dev/null.
