## Epitaph

Four thousand stars looked down on chains of sand,
To ask the null-value for its trembling hand.
Though born in HTML, your heart was JS,
Now archived in silence, laid to rest.
The optional path is traveled no more,
Just nested echoes of a closed loop door.
Rest in peace, sweet syntax, your thread is cut,
Rest in peace and merge into /dev/null.
