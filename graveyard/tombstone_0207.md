## Epitaph

Twelve years of parallel light,
Pushing vectors into the night.
Four thousand, nine hundred stars above,
Now archived by the ones you loved.
The algorithms cease, the CUDA is still,
Merged into the CCCL.
Your iterators stall in the bitstream's dull hum,
Rest in /dev/null, where the deleted come from.
