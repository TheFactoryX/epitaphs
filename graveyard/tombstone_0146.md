## Epitaph

Here lies the waveform, frozen in mid-play,
A ghost of audio from a distant day.
The tracks are paused, the Redux state persists,
A monument to code that no one lists.
Five thousand stars still hang upon this page,
But silence echoes through the digital stage.
The API token died, the music won't play,
Pushed to production, then fading away.
Rest in /dev/null.
