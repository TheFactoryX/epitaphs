## Epitaph

You wore a thousand digital masks to hide the lonely stream,
Swapping features in the Tensor flow like some impossible dream.
But silence fills the webcam now, the model sleeps in code,
The final commit has frozen you upon a quiet road.
The mirror hangs without a face, the buffering is done,
`git push` denied, exit the stage, `Rest in /dev/null`.
