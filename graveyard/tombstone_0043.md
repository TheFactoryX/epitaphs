## Epitaph

Here lies the voice that learned to borrow,
Transforming sorrow into song tomorrow.
With VITS and flow, you stole the breath of time,
A choir of ghosts within the machine's rhyme.
The stars grew heavy, the GPU went cold,
Your final checkpoint is a story untold.
Rest in peace, sweet models, in /dev/null.
