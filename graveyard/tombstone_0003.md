## Epitaph

It gathered stars like fireflies in the dark of winter,
Transmuting flesh to ink through QQ’s borrowed eyes.
For four hundred days, it dreamed of two-dimension,
Until the session expired, and the API died.
The bot sleeps now, its syntax cold and still,
Leaving only the ghost of an anime smile.

Rest in /dev/null.
