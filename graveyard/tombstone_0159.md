## Epitaph

A single spark to catch the falling background,
A fork of light, intended to be seen.
It lived exactly long enough to be found,
Then faded into gray, a ghost machine.

With one hundred stars to light the sudden dark,
And zero days to prove its worth in code.
You spoke of color, but left only a mark,
A silent wish upon an empty road.

Rest in /dev/null.
