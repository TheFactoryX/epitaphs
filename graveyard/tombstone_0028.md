## Epitaph

It harvested wisdom from the infinite cloud,
Converting bytes to knowledge, quiet and proud.
It served the scholar on the Linux screen,
Then drifts of time rendered the code unseen.
The subtitles sleep, the Python scripts grow cold,
Four thousand stars stories left untold.
Now the lecture halls are closed, the lectures cease,
Rest in peace, `udemy-dl`, in `/dev/null` peace.
