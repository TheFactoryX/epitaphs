## Epitaph

Born of Nim, a fleeting ghost in the machine,
You slipped past the Defender's watchful eye.
Sixty-eight days of grace, both sharp and clean,
Before the silence fell and stars ran dry.
Though not archived, the pulse is gone and still,
A bypass now that time itself has killed.
Rest in /dev/null.
