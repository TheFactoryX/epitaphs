## Epitaph

Here lies the code that gave the machine a voice,
For twenty-six thousand stars, a silent choice.
From Raspberry Pi to the GPU’s warm hum,
Now waits in darkness, struck forever dumb.
Though TensorFlow binds the neural weight in vain,
It shall not hear the spoken word again.
Rest in peace, you架构 unspun,
Rest in /dev/null, your work is done.
