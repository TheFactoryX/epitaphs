  "epitaph": "You softened the jagged edges of a retina display,\nA master of frosted glass in an un-cocoa age.\nThough seven years of kindness drifted into gray,\nThe framework is frozen, the UIEffects staged.\nFour thousand stars still hang in the night,\nWatching a UIView that slowly fades away.\nDeleted from podfiles, left out of the light,\nRest in peace in the /dev/null of the day.",
