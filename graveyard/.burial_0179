  "epitaph": "Oh, Kraken, you rose from the Fluttering tide,\nA TypeScript leviathan, high and web-standard.\nFor two short years you swam with stars by your side,\nBut the deep web grew silent, the renderings disband.\nThough the repo lies open, the code breathes no more,\nRest in `/dev/null`, the engine of lore.",
