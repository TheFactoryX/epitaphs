## Epitaph

Here lies the third edition, a tome of heavy thought,
Where Python learned to see and TensorFlow was taught.
Four thousand stars lit up the notebooks' resting face,
Until the final cell went cold, leaving not a trace.
From deep-learning's summit to scikit-learn's embrace,
The master has abandoned this recursive place.
Rest in peace, sweet kernel, no more weights to carry,
Go gently into that dark `/dev/null`, and tarry.
