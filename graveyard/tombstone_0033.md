## Epitaph

You softened the jagged edges of a retina display,
A master of frosted glass in an un-cocoa age.
Though seven years of kindness drifted into gray,
The framework is frozen, the UIEffects staged.
Four thousand stars still hang in the night,
Watching a UIView that slowly fades away.
Deleted from podfiles, left out of the light,
Rest in peace in the /dev/null of the day.
