## Epitaph

Born to modernize the ledger of the past,
You compiled the legacy meant to last.
With C and .NET, you forged the bridge,
But forty years of business wouldn’t budge.
Now the screens are frozen, the syntax still,
A standard unkept, against your will.
The billing is done, the loop is null—
Rest in peace, rest in /dev/null.
