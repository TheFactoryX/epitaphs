## Epitaph

Oh, Kraken, you rose from the Fluttering tide,
A TypeScript leviathan, high and web-standard.
For two short years you swam with stars by your side,
But the deep web grew silent, the renderings disband.
Though the repo lies open, the code breathes no more,
Rest in `/dev/null`, the engine of lore.
