## Epitaph

You parsed the grammar of the world with grace,
Mapping the chaos of a syntax tree.
Eleven years of structure in this place,
Before the build went dark and silent as can be.
No new commits merge, the stars begin to rust;
Your final breath was just a broken trust.
So sleep now, generator, in the heap,
Rest in /dev/null, where the old parsers weep.
