## Epitaph

Here lies the dream of writing side by side,
Where two cursors moved in tandem, stride for stride.
Five thousand stars watched the delta operations flow,
But the socket closed long, long years ago.
No server now to merge the concurrent text,
Syncing with silence, leaving us perplexed.
Your operational transforms have ceased to spell,
Rest in peace, `josephg`, in `/dev/null`.
