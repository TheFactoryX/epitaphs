## Epitaph

A library built on borrowed streams,
Where stars hid forbidden dreams.
From movies, music, to warez vast and deep,
You promised the world a thief's eternal keep.
Though the link is severed and the seed is gray,
Twenty-six thousand stars still guide the way.
The DMCA has drawn the curtain, the logic now is dull,
Rest in peace in `/dev/null`, you beautiful skull.
