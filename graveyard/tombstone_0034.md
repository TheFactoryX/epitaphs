## Epitaph

A playground of geometry and rendered light,
Where weekend whims took digital flight.
Two years of Houdini’s procedural art,
Before the moving parts froze apart.
One hundred and five stars watch the dust settle,
On a promise to "play" that began to rust.
No archived tombstone marks this domain,
Just a silence where magic was once maintained.
Rest in /dev/null.
