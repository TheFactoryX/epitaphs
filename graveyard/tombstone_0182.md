## Epitaph

You sprinted through the Python scripts to catch the morning train,
Thirty-four thousand stars reflected in your streaming pane.
Though the captcha fails and the ticket gates are rusted tight,
The ghost of a booking lingers in the digital night.
Final commit: April rain, the journey is curtailed.
Rest in `socket.timeout`, connection finally failed.
