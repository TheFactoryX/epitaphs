## Epitaph

Here lies the student who taught the machine,
Thirty bright notebooks, a vibrant regime.
From Matplotlib plots to the Neural Net's dream,
A pythonic prayer, a seamless data stream.
Two years of dancing with logic and code,
Now silent, the notebook’s last cell is closed.
Rest in /dev/null, your epoch has turned cold.
