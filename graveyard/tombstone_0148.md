## Epitaph

It lived three thousand days between the brackets,
A framework built of web upon the web.
Though thirty-thousand stars once lit its syntax,
The pull requests have long since been laid to bed.
The editor is closed, the tabs have greyed;
What was written in the DOM has silently decayed.

Rest in /dev/null.
