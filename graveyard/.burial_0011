  "epitaph": "You rose on the twenty-sixth, a script of cold command,\nTo pry the open APEX key and exploit all the land.\nOne hundred stars bore witness to your fragile, shell-born might,\nBefore the silence gathered you, just five days into the night.\nThough unarchived and frozen in the digital abyss,\nYour memory lingers on, a ghost of pure dissonance.\nSo sleep now, little obituary, in logic\u2019s final well,\nAnd `exit 0` forever into `/dev/null`.",
