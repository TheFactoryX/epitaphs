  "epitaph": "Here lies the shield against the all-seeing eye,\nA sanctuary where four thousand stars comply.\nYou taught us vanish from the digital glare,\nTo scrub the data lingering in the air.\nNow silence falls upon the OSINT fight,\nThe repository sleeps in endless night.\nCommit your final ghost, delete the sum,\nRest in peace, dear project, rest in /dev/null.",
