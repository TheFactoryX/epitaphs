## Epitaph

Here lies the mind that spun in JavaScript threads,
A Keras dream woven in WebGL.
From the glory of nearly five thousand stars to the silence of threads,
The neural network has shut down; the neurons fell.
Gone to silicon slumber, the browser grows cold,
Your epoch has ended, your story is told.
Rest in `lib/defunct/keras.js`.
