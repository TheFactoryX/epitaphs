## Epitaph

It was a beautiful static dream, where the triple-curled braces sang,
Thirty-six thousand stars admired the language it defied.
Born in the autumn of the API, when the dark mode first began,
Now the generator hums its last, the Middleman has died.

Four days have passed since the commit, the pull requests are still,
It served the documentation with a cold and classic pride.
We thank you for the clarity, we lay down your goodwill,
And archive your perfection in the Git void, side by side.

Rest in /dev/null.
