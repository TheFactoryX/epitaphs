## Epitaph

Four thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three stars
Looked down on the tests and the mocking of fools.
You lived for eight years before the autumn
Froze your last breath, retired from tools.
Though you lie silent and archived in gray,
Your doubles and ghosts shall not leave us in vain.
Sleep now, Sebastian, in memory's way;
Rest in peace in /dev/null.
