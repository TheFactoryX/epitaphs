## Epitaph

A bright and blooming TypeScript flame,
That burned for just three hundred days.
You drew in thirty thousand stars,
Then watched the interest drift away.
The components you constructed lie
In digital decay, replaced and still;
Go gently into that dark command line,
Rest in peace, `rm -rf`.
