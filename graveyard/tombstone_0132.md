## Epitaph

It was written in Rust, to guard against the decay of time,
Gathering scattered moments into a synchronized rhyme.
One hundred and twenty-nine stars watched the calendar spin,
Until the threads went silent and the aggregator grew thin.
Though the CalDAV connection is severed and the Nix builds fail to pass,
Your dates remain frozen in the open-source grass.
Rest in /dev/null.
