## Epitaph

The bridge between two languages, built in HTML light,
One hundred and eighty-eight stars watched in the night.
Though the CRC was written, the pixels fade to gray,
Two years of silence since the R could find its way.
No commits wake the engine, the syntax stands still,
`Rest in /dev/null`, silent code, until.
