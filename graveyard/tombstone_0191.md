## Epitaph

He sought to rule the chaos of the script,
A Rust-forged Rome to bind the disjointed Web.
But linters rise and linters fall adrift,
And three short years was all the grace he e’er was given.

Twenty-three thousand stars watched from the dark,
Before the commit message ceased to flow.
Archived in silence, a monolithic spark,
That burned too bright, then compiled no more. Rest in /dev/null.
