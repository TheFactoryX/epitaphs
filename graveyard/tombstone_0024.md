## Epitaph

Here lies the scholar of the split screen dream,
Who paused the lecture to transcribe the stream.
Though timestamps anchor where the thoughts began,
The video halts and reaches not the end.
No commit shall seek the second line of verse,
Abandoned in the shadows of the curse.
Sleep now, forgotten logic, in the heap,
Rest in /dev/null.
