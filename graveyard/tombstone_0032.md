## Epitaph

Four thousand stars bore witness to the order you bestowed,
When scopes were bound and promises were young.
The best practices of a dying age you faithfully modeled,
Now unmerged branches lie forever in the dark.
The `ng-app` is silent, the digest cycle complete,
Rest in peace, sweet logic, in /dev/null.
