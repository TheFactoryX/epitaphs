  "epitaph": "You promised the web would survive when the signal faded away,\nA service worker vigilant, keeping the data at bay.\nFour thousand stars looked on as you connected the lonely,\nBut seven winters of silence have left you only phantasmal.\nThe world went online, and you, an off-line ghost, were banished,\nInto the static where the network requests are all vanished.\nRest in /dev/null.",
