## Epitaph

Here lies the widget that dragged and dropped the world,
A symphony of progress bars, beautifully unfurled.
It shepherded thirty thousand stars through the dark,
Resuming broken chunks with a patient spark.
Though jQuery fades and the branch is now quiet,
Its legacy uploads, a silent digital diet.
The form is submitted, the callback is null.
