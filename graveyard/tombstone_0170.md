## Epitaph

Born of a symphony in a coffee script key,
You promised the hackable world to the free.
Sixty thousand stars watched the Electron decay,
As the Sublime clone faded to silent gray.
Four thousand days of a beautiful, tangled regime,
Now archived in darkness—a closed editor’s dream.
Commit your changes to the void, where lost data runs null,
Rest in /dev/null, sweet atom, a beautiful hull.
