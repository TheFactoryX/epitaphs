## Epitaph

It parsed the soul of the machine in vibrant ASCII hue,
A faithful bash companion, knowing every RAM and CPU.
With fifty thousand stars aligned to gaze upon the screen,
The master branch was severed, the pipes no longer clean.
No more distros to be fetched, no screenshots to be taken,
The terminal is silent where the promise once wakened.
Your run has ended, memory freed, your filehandles closed at last,
Rest in peace, you lovely script, within the /dev/null vast.
