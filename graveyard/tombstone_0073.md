## Epitaph

Upon the Raspberry’s gentle hum, your voice was rendered true,
A tethered whisper in the code, a distinct C++ hue.
From server banks to pockets deep, you listened without cease,
Now twenty thousand stars look down upon your peace.
The microphone has gone to static, the neural nets unwind,
Leaving silence in the dataset you left behind.

Rest in `SIGTERM`.
