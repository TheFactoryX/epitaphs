## Epitaph

It rendered a world without windows or light,
A ghost in the shell, doing the DOM’s heavy lifting.
Four thousand days of headless delight,
Before the Chrome Engines began their outdrifting.
No driver was needed for screens made of sand;
The Phantom has vanished, leaving code in his hand.
The stars still remember, though the window is null,
Rest in peace, Phantom, and sleep in /dev/null.
