## Epitaph

A titan of the drag-and-drop, now frozen in the byte,
You shepherded thirty thousand stars through the ethernet's night.
The progress bar is stalled at last; the upload won't resume,
No server hears the chunked request of this antiquated plume.
Though jQuery fades and scripts expire, your legacy remains,
An artifact of patience 'midst the shifting, coded rains.
Rest in /dev/null.
