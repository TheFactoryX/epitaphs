## Epitaph

Here lies the voice that learned to mimic art,
A neural choir forged from PyTorch and heart.
It turned the stream, it made the silence bloom,
Before it met the silence of the tomb.
Though twenty thousand stars lit up its code,
The archive gates have quietly now closed.
For voices that no longer compute or scull,
Rest in peace in `/dev/null`.
