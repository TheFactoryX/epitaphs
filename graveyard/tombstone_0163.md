## Epitaph

Here lies the engine forged in Dart’s cold fire,
A dream of scripting Flutter’s bright desire.
Though seven hundred days have passed in gray,
Nineteen stars still watch the sleep of clay.
Two worlds entwined in logic now must part,
The virtual breath has fled the art.
Rest in /dev/null.
