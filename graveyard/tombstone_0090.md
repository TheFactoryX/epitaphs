## Epitaph

You woke from silicon to grant us 1.25 and 2.0,
A kingdom of Assembly, stark, singular, and true.
Though six years have passed and the commits have ceased to flow,
You remain the ghost in the machine, the foundation of blue.
So power down your sectors and let the interrupt call fade,
The legendary prompt where the first operations were made.
Rest in /dev/null.
