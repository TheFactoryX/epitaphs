## Epitaph

You stood so long upon the wall of glass,
Watching the signals of the registry pass.
A Go-born guardian in a Docker sea,
With twenty-four thousand stars for company.
But now the pull is halted, the update’s silent,
Your history commited to the digital violent.
Sleep now, sweet watcher, your final cycle done,
Rest in peace within `/dev/null`.
