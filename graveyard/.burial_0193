  "epitaph": "Born in the autumn of twenty-thirteen,\nA Bootstrap of buttons, so polished and clean.\nYou promised the function, you offered the style,\nBut left the world silent for quite a long while.\nYour pixels are dust and your grids are decayed,\nTwo thousand days since a commit was made.\nYour stars still shine on, though the lights are all dim,\nRest in /dev/null, PixelKit.",
