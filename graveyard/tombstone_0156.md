## Epitaph

Here lies the shell that shortened our commands,
A flickering tip for the Fish in the sands.
Four years of keystrokes, streamlined and brief,
Now archived by silence, conquered by grief.
Though unmerged in death, the memory swells—
Of the helper that knew our acronyms too well.
Rest in /dev/null.
