## Epitaph

It wrapped the boundless web in a window’s small embrace,
A thirty-thousand-star embrace, held in static space.
The Electron pulse has faded, the Node is still and dry,
For all its promised standalone dreams, it was not born to fly.
Now the shell script echoes silence where the binaries used to be,
Archived in the digital dusk, a ghost of memory.
Rest in /dev/null.
