## Epitaph

It sought to clothe the naked silence of the song,
Fetching the vibrant sleeves for lonely, digital bytes.
But for seven hundred and thirty days, the scripts have hung
Suspended in the twilight of uncommitted writes.
No more shall artwork bloom within the FLAC or the MP3,
The cover art remains a mystery, lost to history.
Rest in /dev/null.
