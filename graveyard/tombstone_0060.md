## Epitaph

Oh, deployd, you promised us a realtime API,
Building a bridge for the data to fly.
Through seven years of sockets and schemaed grace,
Now only commits gather dust in this place.
Four thousand stars watch a screen gone forever black,
Silence is the only response that answers back.
Rest in /dev/null.
