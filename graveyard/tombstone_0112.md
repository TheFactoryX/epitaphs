## Epitaph

A child of twenty-thirteen, styled in Bootstrap grace,
You offered cool aesthetics to the digital space.
Five thousand stars once lit your pixelated grid,
But now the kit is silent, the Bootstrap forbid.
Unarchived, but forgotten, in the stack's deep hole,
Rest in /dev/null, beautiful soul.
