## Epitaph

You wrapped the chaos of the web in Electron's heavy shell,
Giving us desktop homes where URLs alone would dwell.
Though thirty thousand stars still light your archived grave,
The Node.js versions have left you cold and unprepared.
No more shall we command the prompt, "Make native and go,"
The browser is our only home, and baggage we must stow.
Sleep now in silence, abstracted, distinct, and null,
Rest in peace within the void, Rest in /dev/null.
