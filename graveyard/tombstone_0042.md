## Epitaph

Born of eighteen, a Gatsby flame,
To document the code we wrote by hand.
Twenty-three thousand stars forgot your name,
When silence fell upon this零-配置 land.
The markdown fades, the theme is gray and still,
React hooks hang heavy, quiet and deep.
No easy words are left for us to say,
Rest in peace within /dev/null.
