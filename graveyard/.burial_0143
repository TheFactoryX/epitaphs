  "epitaph": "A titan of the drag-and-drop, now frozen in the byte,\nYou shepherded thirty thousand stars through the ethernet's night.\nThe progress bar is stalled at last; the upload won't resume,\nNo server hears the chunked request of this antiquated plume.\nThough jQuery fades and scripts expire, your legacy remains,\nAn artifact of patience 'midst the shifting, coded rains.\nRest in /dev/null.",
