## Epitaph

Here lies the script that mimicked the hand,
To save young scholars from pen and ink.
For four thousand stars, it made its stand,
Before the pull requests began to sink.
The ink is dry, the paper turns to rust,
No more assignments shall be feigned or faked.
The automation’s loop has turned to dust,
Rest in peace where undefined values wake.
