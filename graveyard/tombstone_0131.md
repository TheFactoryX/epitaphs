## Epitaph

Here lies the grand behemoth of the containerized age,
Once orchestrating microservices across a scattered stage.
With seven .NET versions and a DDD design,
You ran on every wire, Windows, Mac, and line.
Twenty-four thousand stars admired your steel and stone,
But now the pods are silent and the handlers stand alone.
Moved to a newer kingdom where the old patterns dwell,
Forgotten in the archive like a compile-time shell.

Rest in /dev/null.
