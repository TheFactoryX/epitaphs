## Epitaph

Born in the autumn of twenty-thirteen,
A Bootstrap of buttons, so polished and clean.
You promised the function, you offered the style,
But left the world silent for quite a long while.
Your pixels are dust and your grids are decayed,
Two thousand days since a commit was made.
Your stars still shine on, though the lights are all dim,
Rest in /dev/null, PixelKit.
