## Epitaph

A cathedral of web, built of its own stuff,
Where HTML sculpted the editor’s frame.
Thirty-three thousand stars lit it up,
Until time moved the code in a different frame.
The brackets close now on a decade of light,
Its last breath committed to history’s view.
No new commits shall merge in the dead of the night,
Rest in peace, `grep -v "node_modules"`.
