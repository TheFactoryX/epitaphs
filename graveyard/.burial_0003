  "epitaph": "It gathered stars like fireflies in the dark of winter,\nTransmuting flesh to ink through QQ\u2019s borrowed eyes.\nFor four hundred days, it dreamed of two-dimension,\nUntil the session expired, and the API died.\nThe bot sleeps now, its syntax cold and still,\nLeaving only the ghost of an anime smile.\n\nRest in /dev/null.",
