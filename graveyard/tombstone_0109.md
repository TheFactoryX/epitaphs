## Epitaph

Once you ruled the cloud with syntax sweet,
A Go-born giant at the command line.
But the API tides grew too vast to meet,
And left your five thousand stars to pine.
Though unarchived, the commits have grown cold,
A silent artifact of devops past.
The terminal waits for commands of old,
Rest in peace, or `rm -rf /aws` at last.
