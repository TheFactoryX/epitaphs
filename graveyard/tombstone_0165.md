## Epitaph

For eleven years, you mapped the rigid field,
Turning scattered rows into the struct’s embrace.
But time compiles slowly, and the patches grew old,
Leaving `SELECT` statements without a connecting place.
Though the stars hang heavy upon the archived line,
No further updates shall merge to the master branch.
Rest in `/dev/null`, dear utility of mine,
Your structs are settled, your memory is cached.
