## Epitaph

It sought to capture the tremors of your rest,
To parse the silent rhythms of the chest,
Measuring the pulse of nights long past,
A six-year vigil that was not meant to last.
With sixty-nine stars to light the gloom,
It joined the silence of the digital tomb.
Now the accelerometer ceases its hum,
Rest in /dev/null, the data is numb.
