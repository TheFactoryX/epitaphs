## Epitaph

Here lies the concept rendered in gradients old,
A Material heart where Java’s code was bold.
Six winters passed since the last commit came,
Though stars ignite the dust of its lost name.
It sought to paint the feed in ripple and shadow,
Now sleeps within the repo’s quiet meadow.
Curated stories fade, the library ends,
Rest in peace, `./gradlew assembleDebug`.
