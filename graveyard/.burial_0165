  "epitaph": "For eleven years, you mapped the rigid field,\nTurning scattered rows into the struct\u2019s embrace.\nBut time compiles slowly, and the patches grew old,\nLeaving `SELECT` statements without a connecting place.\nThough the stars hang heavy upon the archived line,\nNo further updates shall merge to the master branch.\nRest in `/dev/null`, dear utility of mine,\nYour structs are settled, your memory is cached.",
