## Epitaph

You cataloged the magic hidden in the shell,
Where thirty thousand wanderers learned to cast their spell.
But while the list was "awesome," time was not your friend,
And nineteen faded out before the year would end.
Though silenced by the keeper, your legacy remains:
A bright prompt in the darkness of these silicon chains.

Rest in /dev/null.
