  "epitaph": "You parsed the grammar of the world with grace,\nMapping the chaos of a syntax tree.\nEleven years of structure in this place,\nBefore the build went dark and silent as can be.\nNo new commits merge, the stars begin to rust;\nYour final breath was just a broken trust.\nSo sleep now, generator, in the heap,\nRest in /dev/null, where the old parsers weep.",
