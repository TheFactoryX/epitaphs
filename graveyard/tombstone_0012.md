## Epitaph

Here lies the page, asymmetric and bold,
A decade of typesmithing, perfectly told.
No more shall the compile log brighten the screen,
The fonts are unrendered, the stylesheet unseen.
Though the undergraduate years have flown past,
Your XeTeX syntax was built to outlast.
So shift-delete the dreams of the coder in school,
And `rm -rf` the rest of the formatting rule.
