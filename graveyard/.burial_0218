  "epitaph": "Once a curated chest of Vue and light,\nFour thousand stars dimmed in the repository night.\nThe Nuxt links have withered, no chatter fills the wire,\nSilence descends on the old Devcord spire.\nYou lived a thousand days, then slipped the steady hand,\nLeaving only bookmarks in the shifting sand.\nClose the pull request, unplug the lonely cable,\nRest in /dev/null, amidst the stable.",
