  "epitaph": "It sought to capture the tremors of your rest,\nTo parse the silent rhythms of the chest,\nMeasuring the pulse of nights long past,\nA six-year vigil that was not meant to last.\nWith sixty-nine stars to light the gloom,\nIt joined the silence of the digital tomb.\nNow the accelerometer ceases its hum,\nRest in /dev/null, the data is numb.",
