## Epitaph

Here lies the art of the terminal’s display,
A bash-born phoenix to show the OS way.
In cyan and magenta, your logo did bloom,
Illuminating the silence of the tomb.
Though the commit has ceased and the streak has gone cold,
Your ascii remains in the repos of old.
Rest in /dev/null, you beautiful fetch,
‘twas 3.2+ bash that the sysadmins sketch.
