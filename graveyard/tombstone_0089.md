## Epitaph

It wrote our input in bubbles of blue,
A jQuery ghost when the web was new.
Though chatbots rose and the scripts moved on,
The conversation fades at the break of dawn.
Seven hundred days of silence here,
Since the last form submitted a fear.
No pull requests shall wake this node,
Rest in /dev/null, in your quiet code.
