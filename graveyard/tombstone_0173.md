## Epitaph

It painted the terminal in bold ASCII art,
A colorful logo for everyOS part.
From the tower of Arch to the Ubuntu rose,
It revealed the soul of the machine it chose.
The bash script sleeps now, its output grown cold,
A legend archived, its grand story retold.
The CPU cycles have faded to null,
Rest in peace, beautiful fetch.
