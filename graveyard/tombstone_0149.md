## Epitaph

To build a castle of pure Clojure, speech by speech,
Where Uncle Bob reviewed the code within the reach.
But proofs were scribed and left to rust, the links grown dim and cold,
Three hundred stars look down upon a promise unfulfilled.
The window to the Nostr is painted black and still,
We mourn the logic trapped within the parenthesis.
Rest in /dev/null.
