## Epitaph

Here lies the steward of the `vendor` folder’s grace,
Once guardian of dependencies in a simpler place.
Four thousand, nine hundred stars watched it rise and fall,
Until the epoch turned and `go.mod` claimed it all.
Silent for six long years, archived in the digital tomb,
You taught us well to keep our code close to home.
Rest in /vendor/null.
