  "epitaph": "It harvested wisdom from the infinite cloud,\nConverting bytes to knowledge, quiet and proud.\nIt served the scholar on the Linux screen,\nThen drifts of time rendered the code unseen.\nThe subtitles sleep, the Python scripts grow cold,\nFour thousand stars stories left untold.\nNow the lecture halls are closed, the lectures cease,\nRest in peace, `udemy-dl`, in `/dev/null` peace.",
