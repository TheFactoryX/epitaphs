## Epitaph

For thirty thousand stars, you pulled the melody from the ether,
A bridge of JavaScript where the music was freer.
Eight years of rhythm, till the lawyers drew near,
Silencing the node that we held so dear.
Though the API sleeps and the interface is gray,
The songs you unlocked refuse to fade away.
Rest in `return null;`
