## Epitaph

You bridged the river SVN for the Git world alone,
An unofficial mirror carrying the browser's throne.
Though the stars numbered thousands, the topics were bare,
A silent reflection that no one could repair.
The commit hash has frozen, the sync has grown cold,
Eleven years of service, too heavy to hold.
Here lies the echo of awebkit-http,
Rest in /dev/null, where the data is kept.
