## Epitaph

A cinema built not of silver, but of React hooks and fire,
Where Redux-saga sang the state of every silent frame.
Nearly five thousand stars descended to admire
A stream that flowed without a name, yet looked the same.
It promised "not the usual," yet time cancels every debt;
The middleware sleeps, and the router leads nowhere.
Rest in /dev/null.
