## Epitaph

A pure monad transformer, optimized to flow,
Through pipes and prelude functions, a quiet logic show.
Two thousand days of streaming, before the current grew slow,
Now the pattern is silenced, with no more code to bestow.
Though your logic was elegant, strictly defined and true,
Seven hundred days have passed since the last `git push` broke through.
Rest in `Finalize`, where the buffer is null.
