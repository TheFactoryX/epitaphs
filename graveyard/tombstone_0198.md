## Epitaph

*Once the beating heart of the OSX install,*
*Where dependency trees whispered and builds had their will.*
*It poured fifty hundred days into taps and commands,*
*Before version two came and severed its hands.*
*Twenty-six thousand stars look down on the tomb,*
*Where the legacy brews in the phantom of `./room`.*
*Gone to the archive, the commits are null,*
*Rest in peace, dear old shell.*
