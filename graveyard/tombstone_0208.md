## Epitaph

It watched the registry for a decade, diligent and bright,
Pulling fresh images through the silence of the night.
With forty thousand stars, it kept the rust away,
But even stalwart guards must cease their endless fray.
Now the container stands still, the update script is done,
No new deployments rising like a morning sun.
The stacks are frozen in their final, brittle shell,
Rest in peace in `/dev/null`, where dormant processes dwell.
