## Epitaph

It was the cathedral of anxiety, a curated list of lists,
Where mortals sought answers to questions about Java and Rails.
Eighty thousand stars watched the queue gather dust,
Ignoring the truth that no repo can save you.

Now the pull requests sleep and the issues fade to black,
Three thousand days of preparation for a job you didn't take.
Rest in /dev/null.
