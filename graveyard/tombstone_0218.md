## Epitaph

Once a curated chest of Vue and light,
Four thousand stars dimmed in the repository night.
The Nuxt links have withered, no chatter fills the wire,
Silence descends on the old Devcord spire.
You lived a thousand days, then slipped the steady hand,
Leaving only bookmarks in the shifting sand.
Close the pull request, unplug the lonely cable,
Rest in /dev/null, amidst the stable.
