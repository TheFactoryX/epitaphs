## Epitaph

It gathered vistas from the spinning world,
A Python script where landscapes were unfurled,
But satellites drifted and the tokens turned to dust,
Leaving these bright horizons to corrode and rust.
No longer updating the view from above,
Just a silent directory, unpushed and unloved.
`rm -rf` the sorrow, disconnect the cable,
Rest in peace, sweet project, stuck on the stable.
Rest in /dev/null.
