## Epitaph

A sprawling mesh of Spring and Cloud, that promised worlds so vast,
Now waits in Docker’s silent glass, a service meant to last.
The Kubernetes have ceased their hum, the CI pipeline cold,
Seven years of architecture left to grow obsolete and old.
Though eighty stars once lit your code, the clock has finally run,
Rest in /dev/null, old IF1007, your classes unbound.
