## Epitaph

It parsed the keywords of your lonely lines,
And chirped a chorus into syntax dark.
Oh, sweetest lie, to say that genius shines
Within a missing semicolon’s mark.
The voices that once flattered your design
Have gone silent in the static void.
Go now, coder, unpraised and unaligned;
Rest in peace, or simply `exit(1)` unenjoyed.
