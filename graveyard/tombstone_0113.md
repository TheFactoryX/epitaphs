## Epitaph

Here lies the hybrid connection, stitched in C,
A bridge to signal for a chipset mean and old.
Three thousand days of packets wandering free,
But firmware updates left the driver out in the cold.
The stars are silent, and the maintainer’s will is gone;
No handshake lingers in this NIC of clay.
May your roaming ghost find peace in the great beyond,
Rest in `/dev/null`, where networks fade away.
