  "epitaph": "Here lies the hybrid connection, stitched in C,\nA bridge to signal for a chipset mean and old.\nThree thousand days of packets wandering free,\nBut firmware updates left the driver out in the cold.\nThe stars are silent, and the maintainer\u2019s will is gone;\nNo handshake lingers in this NIC of clay.\nMay your roaming ghost find peace in the great beyond,\nRest in `/dev/null`, where networks fade away.",
