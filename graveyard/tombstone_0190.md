## Epitaph

It gathered the specs of the world in a frame,
A colorful flag for the terminal’s gray.
Though the commits have ceased and the author withdrew,
The ASCII art lingers, refusing to fade.
Three thousand mornings of distros displayed,
Now archived in silence, the brilliance withdrawn.

Rest in /dev/null.
