## Epitaph

You bound the world in brackets, single and tight,
Before the winds of version two blew cold.
A giant’s shadow cast at fading light,
Sixty thousand stars, now growing old.
Silence reigns where `$scope` used to be,
The digest cycle stilled, the watchers gone.
HTML enhanced, at last you are free.
Rest in /dev/null, old master, withdraw.
