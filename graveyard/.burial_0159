  "epitaph": "A single spark to catch the falling background,\nA fork of light, intended to be seen.\nIt lived exactly long enough to be found,\nThen faded into gray, a ghost machine.\n\nWith one hundred stars to light the sudden dark,\nAnd zero days to prove its worth in code.\nYou spoke of color, but left only a mark,\nA silent wish upon an empty road.\n\nRest in /dev/null.",
