## Epitaph

It scraped the feed and signed the endless scroll,
A thirsty script to drink the viral flow.
Four thousand stars lit up its TypeScript soul,
But the API shifted and the config broke.
Now "page not found" replaces every byte,
Silence where the dancing data flowed.
Sleep now, abandoned logic, in the night,
Rest in /dev/null.
