  "epitaph": "It was forged in TypeScript fire to ride the Flutter wave,\nA high-performance renderer, a standard so brave.\nTwo years of light, then the commits went slow,\nLeaving nearly five thousand stars aglow.\nSilent for a thousand days, the issues now still,\nUnarchived and waiting, against logic and will.\nThe web page loads heavy, the dream is now dull,\nRest in peace, Kraken, return to `/dev/null`.",
