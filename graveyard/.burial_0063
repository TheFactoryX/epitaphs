  "epitaph": "Here lies the third edition, a tome of heavy thought,\nWhere Python learned to see and TensorFlow was taught.\nFour thousand stars lit up the notebooks' resting face,\nUntil the final cell went cold, leaving not a trace.\nFrom deep-learning's summit to scikit-learn's embrace,\nThe master has abandoned this recursive place.\nRest in peace, sweet kernel, no more weights to carry,\nGo gently into that dark `/dev/null`, and tarry.",
