## Epitaph

Here lies the neural dream of a simpler time,
Spun in Python with Keras and grace.
It once wove new words from the dataset of old,
Before the large models stole the show's place.
Four thousand stars hang cold in the dark,
Its last epoch faded five years ago.
Go softly to sleep in the heap’s void now,
Rest in peace, `textgenrnn`, gone to /dev/null.
