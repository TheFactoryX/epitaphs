## Epitaph

Four winters you mimicked the pulse and the breath,
A seamless mask for the webcam’s cold eye.
Thirty thousand stars lit your ascent into death,
Before the last frame and the final goodbye.
No streamer shall wear you, no caller connect,
The GPU cools where the tensors did dwell.
You taught us the truth is a subjective effect,
Rest in peace in `//dev/null`.
