## Epitaph

It gathered five thousand stars in the lonely firmament,
A bridge for divided cursors to meet and mend.
But the conflicts grew too complex to resolve,
And the sockets closed on the twelfth of September.
No "Conflict-Free" transform could save this synchrony,
As ten winters freeze the sockets of the weaver.
Gone to the great buffer in the sky, now and always.
Rest in /dev/null.
