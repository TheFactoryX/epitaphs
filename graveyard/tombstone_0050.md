## Epitaph

Oh, **Maybe**, the treasure we sought to attain,
A wealth for the many, untethered from chain.
The stack was Ruby, the vision was bright,
But books have their closing, as does every night.
For five hundred and seventy days you held sway,
Now "Hotwire" goes cold where the turbo decayed.
`git commit --allow-empty` to memories null,
Rest in `/dev/null`, beautiful skull.
