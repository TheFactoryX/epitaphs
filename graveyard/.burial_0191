  "epitaph": "He sought to rule the chaos of the script,\nA Rust-forged Rome to bind the disjointed Web.\nBut linters rise and linters fall adrift,\nAnd three short years was all the grace he e\u2019er was given.\n\nTwenty-three thousand stars watched from the dark,\nBefore the commit message ceased to flow.\nArchived in silence, a monolithic spark,\nThat burned too bright, then compiled no more. Rest in /dev/null.",
