## Epitaph

You promised a safe harbor for the ESP8266,
A Rust-veined dream, experimental and bold.
Four years of light, though often obscure,
Before the binaries went silently cold.
A hundred stars watch your code now grow old,
Memory leaks plugged, the dependencies null.
Here lie the spikes you withdrew from the pile,
Rest in peace, `esp8266-hal`, rest in /dev/null.
