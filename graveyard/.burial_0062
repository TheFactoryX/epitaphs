  "epitaph": "It opened a port to welcome the dark,\nTo capture the binaries, vicious and stark,\nBut seven years of shadows have passed in the mist,\nAnd the botnets have moved to a new protocol list.\nUnarchived, yet silent, the scripts cease to run,\nUnder the weight of a setting sun.\nNo packet shall pass, no infection shall null,\nRest in peace in `/dev/null`.",
