## Epitaph

You woke the web with symbols bright,
A sanctuary of syntax bathed in electric light.
With nodes and electrons, you hackable heart,
Promising to tear the text world apart.
Sixty thousand stars watched the decree,
When your core was frozen on Git’s dark tree.
The merge conflicts settled, the PMs cease,
Rest in /dev/null, O hackers' peace.
