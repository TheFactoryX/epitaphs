## Epitaph

It parsed the world with a feverish haste,
A monument built on insecure grace.
Though promised "2.0" to heal the scar,
The warnings went unheeded from afar.
The stars remain, a gleaming, heavy weight,
For code that sealed a deserialization fate.
Here lies the speed that crashed the system down,
Rest in /dev/null, beneath the silent ground.
