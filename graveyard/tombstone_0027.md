## Epitaph

Batea, the fortune-teller, who read the packets’ hidden heart,
Promised wisdom from the chaos, a device ranking work of art.
Thirty hundred stars stood witness to your context-driven mind,
Now the flow of traffic halts, leaving algorithms blind.
Though the network hums without you, and the lessons fade away,
Your context sits in silence, where the data packs decay.
Rest in `void`.
