## Epitaph

It ran on Electron and the glow of neon blue,
A sci-fi shell that promised systems brave and new.
Though forty thousand stars illuminated the grid,
The touchscreen went unpressed, and the console interface was hid.
No longer blasting packets to the beat of Tron’s light,
The window’s closed, the kernel has lost its bite.
So archive the source, let the commit hash fade to null,
Rest in /dev/null, you beautiful, hollow skull.
