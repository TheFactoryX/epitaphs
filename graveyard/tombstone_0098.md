## Epitaph

Here lies the Pure Bash Bible, unspooled and unbound,
No longer forking processes, only resounding sound.
A once-sacred text of the elegant hack,
Now the README is faded, and the branches are black.
Though the stars still hang heavy in the heavens above,
This script has ceased execution, devoid of any love.
You parsed all the strings and you trimmed all the lines,
Now sleep in the silence of closed-out times.

Rest in `unset` history.
