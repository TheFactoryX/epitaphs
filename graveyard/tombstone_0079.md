## Epitaph

Seeking passage home on the Festival’s rush,
You parsed the captcha and waited to crush
The wall of the server. But time is a train
That departs the station and never again
Returns for the passenger, quiet or loud.
The tickets are sold out; your script is not proud.
Here lies the Selenium, stopped in its run,
Rest in peace, `return None`.
