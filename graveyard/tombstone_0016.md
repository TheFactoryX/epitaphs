## Epitaph

It saw the world in shifts and epochs, unsupervised and stark,
Mapping change within the pixels, the subtle and the dark.
Deep Kernel PCA sought the truth that time had tried to hide,
But the stars that once numbered seventy-four have since diminished wide.
A paper published, a legacy written, then the commits went to zero,
Leaving only ghostly tensor dust in the GitHub repo.
Abandoned to the silence, frozen in the binary thrall,
Rest in /dev/null, oh faithful Net, you gave it your all.
