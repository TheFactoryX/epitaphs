## Epitaph

You caught the whispers of a restless Objective-C mind,
A modern beacon for a chaotic, debugging time.
For thirteen years you tracked the crash and the trace,
Until the heartbeat failed in an August embrace.
Now five thousand stars shine cold upon your code,
Silent logs where no more data will be flowed.
Rest in `dev/null`, you magnificent, silent console.
