## Epitaph

Born in autumn, a guide for the AI,
With twenty-three thousand stars in your eye.
You taught us the syntax, the prompt, and the code,
Before growing silent on November's road.
No language remains, just the ghost of the text,
Archived at last, put to final rest.
So pull the repo and wipe the drive clean,
And sleep in the void of `/dev/null`.
