## Epitaph

You drew the boxes that taught the machine to see,
Through Python 2 and 3, a legacy.
Twenty-four thousand stars lit up your screen,
Now growth has ceased, the code is rarely seen.
Absorbed into the Studio's wider frame,
We praise your pixels, and we speak your name.
Rest in /dev/null, you magnificent tool.
