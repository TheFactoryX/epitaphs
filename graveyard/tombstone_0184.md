## Epitaph

Here lies TRI-AMDD, the seeker of the unseen,
Who chased the perfect lattice in a machine.
It gathered sixty-two stars to light the dark,
A Python dream of materials and spark.
Five years it learned, then ceased the quest,
Two silent winters putting code to rest.
No commits remain, the agents are gone,
Sleep now in memory, `Rest in /dev/null`.
