  "epitaph": "You wrapped the chaos of the web in Electron's heavy shell,\nGiving us desktop homes where URLs alone would dwell.\nThough thirty thousand stars still light your archived grave,\nThe Node.js versions have left you cold and unprepared.\nNo more shall we command the prompt, \"Make native and go,\"\nThe browser is our only home, and baggage we must stow.\nSleep now in silence, abstracted, distinct, and null,\nRest in peace within the void, Rest in /dev/null.",
