## Epitaph

Born in the June of frameworks past,
You served the controllers until the last.
Though archived, four thousand stars still gleam,
A fossil caught in a static stream.
Silent these four winters, cold and deleted,
Your servlet context, finally depleted.
Rest in peace, compile once more,
Rest in /dev/null, forevermore.
