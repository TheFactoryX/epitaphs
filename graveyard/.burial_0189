  "epitaph": "For ten long years you kept the watch, undying,\nA silent sentinel beneath the stacks of Go.\nWith endless hope you pulled the base image, trying\nTo patch the holes that time allowed to grow.\nBut even guardians must close their weary eyes,\nLeft archived here beneath the frozen skies.\nNo more commits, no more notifications to send.\nRest in peace, `RuntimeError`. Update your end.",
