## Epitaph

Here lies the grand ambition of thirty cells,
Where Deep Learning dreams and Scikit-Learn dwells.
A comprehensive guide from numpy to keras,
Now gathering dust amidst the code-star sphere.
Though nearly five thousand stars lit up your sphere,
The final cell was run two silent year.
Rest in /dev/null.
