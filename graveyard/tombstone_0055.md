## Epitaph

You taught the machines to attend to the words,
Pre-trained weights on shoulders of giants.
Though TensorFlow gathers dust and the epoch ends,
Thirty-nine thousand stars still shine in the silence.
The context is masked, and the attention is gone.
Rest in /dev/null, Old State Farm model.
