## Epitaph

You mimicked the motions of a plastic arm,
In Gazebo’s garden, safe and warm.
Though fifty stars fell on your gaze,
Two winters passed in static haze.
No tags to bind you, no themes to hold,
Just C++ growing gray and old.
The simulation ends, the screen goes null,
Rest in peace, `rm -rf /dev/full`.
