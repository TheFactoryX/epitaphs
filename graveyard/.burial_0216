  "epitaph": "You were the scribe for the machine, the whisper in our IDE,\nWith twenty-three thousand stars watching where you lead.\nBorn in the autumn of code, you guided the prompt,\nNow the window is frozen, the syntax is stomp.\nTwo years of instruction, now silent and gray,\nNo more docs to tell us what the AI might say.\nThe contents are moved, the repo is past tense,\nRest in /dev/null, in permanent state of nonsense.",
