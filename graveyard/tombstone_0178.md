## Epitaph

You promised the web would survive when the signal faded away,
A service worker vigilant, keeping the data at bay.
Four thousand stars looked on as you connected the lonely,
But seven winters of silence have left you only phantasmal.
The world went online, and you, an off-line ghost, were banished,
Into the static where the network requests are all vanished.
Rest in /dev/null.
