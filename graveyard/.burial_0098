  "epitaph": "Here lies the Pure Bash Bible, unspooled and unbound,\nNo longer forking processes, only resounding sound.\nA once-sacred text of the elegant hack,\nNow the README is faded, and the branches are black.\nThough the stars still hang heavy in the heavens above,\nThis script has ceased execution, devoid of any love.\nYou parsed all the strings and you trimmed all the lines,\nNow sleep in the silence of closed-out times.\n\nRest in `unset` history.",
