  "epitaph": "It ran on Electron and the glow of neon blue,\nA sci-fi shell that promised systems brave and new.\nThough forty thousand stars illuminated the grid,\nThe touchscreen went unpressed, and the console interface was hid.\nNo longer blasting packets to the beat of Tron\u2019s light,\nThe window\u2019s closed, the kernel has lost its bite.\nSo archive the source, let the commit hash fade to null,\nRest in /dev/null, you beautiful, hollow skull.",
