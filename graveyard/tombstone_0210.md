## Epitaph

Here lies the polished dream of jade and crimson light,
A Java heart that mimicked filters in the night.
Once praised by five thousand stars for code so clean and bright,
Now abandoned, a ghost app in an endless white.
Material Design crumbles, the concept drifts apart;
An orphan of the Google Play, bereft of art.
Rest in /dev/null.
