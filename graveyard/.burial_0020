  "epitaph": "Here lies the debugger, the scalpel, the wall,\nThe master of IL who disassembled it all.\nTwenty-eight thousand stars watched you break the binary chain,\nBefore the last commit left you frozen in pain.\nNo longer to patch or crack or inspect,\nYou drift into bit-rot, cold and correct.\n\nRest in /dev/null.",
