## Epitaph

Here lies **druce/rl**, a gambler’s grand design,
Chasing the green candle with a Deep Q mind.
It sought to beat the market, to profit and to learn,
But four years of training could not discern
The trend from the noise, the loss from the gain.
Now the kernel is dead, and the notebook in vain.
One hundred and eight stars watch the silent display,
As the agent sleeps forever, with no balance to pay.

Rest in `/dev/null`.
