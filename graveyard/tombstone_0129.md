## Epitaph

You rose in the August of Windows' reign,
To whisper "cease" to the data train.
A Python script for the paranoid soul,
To wall the garden and make the user whole.
Now the keys are silent, the hosts file still,
Whatever they gathered, they always will.
Rest in peace, far from the ping and the pull,
Rest in /dev/null.
