## Epitaph

For twelve years you conjured the phantom real,
Fabricating names, streets, and companies.
You filled the hollow databases with
The lies that serve to prove the truth.
Now the commits have ceased, the Faker sleeps,
An architect of dreams left incomplete.
`Rest in /dev/null` amidst the silent strings.
