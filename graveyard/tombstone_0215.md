## Epitaph

Born in the chill of a TypeScript winter,
You offered the oracle’s fire to the cursor.
Four thousand stars watched you dream in syntax,
Before the API keys were revoked and the connection was lost.
Though the features remain, the soul is departed,
Leaving only a ghost in the directory tree.
Rest in `//dev/null`.
