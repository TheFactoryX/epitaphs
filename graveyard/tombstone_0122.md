## Epitaph

Here lies the tunnel that breached the wall,
A unified ingress for one and for all.
Forty thousand mornings of open delight,
Before the key turned and locked out the light.
Through localhost shadows, the packets still run,
Silenced by order, but missed by everyone.
Rest in /dev/null, secure in your shell,
With nowhere to left to forward, farewell.
