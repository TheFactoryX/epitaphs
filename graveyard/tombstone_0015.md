## Epitaph

You held the chaos of a list in gentle hands,
Mapping the physics of a drag through React's shifting lands.
For thirty-four thousand stars, you reordered the mess,
A masterpiece of motion born of `npm install` success.
Now the hook hangs heavy, the placeholder is gone,
The commit hash is frozen, the responsiveness withdrawn.
Though the issues stay open and the stack traces stack,
You’ve dropped your last item and you aren't coming back.

Rest in `undefined`.
