  "epitaph": "You mimicked the motions of a plastic arm,\nIn Gazebo\u2019s garden, safe and warm.\nThough fifty stars fell on your gaze,\nTwo winters passed in static haze.\nNo tags to bind you, no themes to hold,\nJust C++ growing gray and old.\nThe simulation ends, the screen goes null,\nRest in peace, `rm -rf /dev/full`.",
