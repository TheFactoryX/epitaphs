## Epitaph

You watched the production line with TypeScript eyes,
Hunting the ghost in the machine, the silent bug,
From twenty-fifteen until the winter rendered you freeze,
One hundred and sixty-seven stars fell from the sky.
The breakpoint was hit, the stack is unwound,
Your debugger’s probe has finally retired to the ground.
Rest in /dev/null.
