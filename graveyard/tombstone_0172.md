## Epitaph

Here lie four thousand, nine hundred stars,
Now dimmed behind a login wall.
You pulled the knowledge down from afar,
Converting VTTs so subtitles wouldn't stall.
Four years of parsing, forty-two months of light,
Before the DMCA claimed the debt.
The courses are cached, but the repo is tight—
Rest in peace in /dev/null.
