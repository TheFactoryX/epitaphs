## Epitaph

Here dwelled a framework built to right the scale,
To balance where the bias deeply ran.
In fourteen hundred days, it could not quell
The silent drift of Python's aging plan.
The stars are frozen at two sixty-two,
With 'last breath' taken in the winter chill.
No pip install shall summon back the view—
`git commit --amend` and lie quiet still.
Rest in `/dev/null`.
