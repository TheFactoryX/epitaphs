## Epitaph

It opened a port to welcome the dark,
To capture the binaries, vicious and stark,
But seven years of shadows have passed in the mist,
And the botnets have moved to a new protocol list.
Unarchived, yet silent, the scripts cease to run,
Under the weight of a setting sun.
No packet shall pass, no infection shall null,
Rest in peace in `/dev/null`.
