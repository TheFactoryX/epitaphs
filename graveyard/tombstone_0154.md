## Epitaph

Born in the spring of twenty-thirteen,
To mock the GWT that kept us keen.
For eleven years you served the Java stream,
Now silent in the bitstream’s cold regime.
Though unarchived, your heart has ceased its beat,
A ghost within the Git, unable to delete.
Rest in /dev/null.

---

**Description:** Better GWT unit testing

**Topics:** None

**Archived:** No

**Repository:** [google/gwtmockito](https://github.com/google/gwtmockito)
