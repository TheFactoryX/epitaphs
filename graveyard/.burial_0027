  "epitaph": "Batea, the fortune-teller, who read the packets\u2019 hidden heart,\nPromised wisdom from the chaos, a device ranking work of art.\nThirty hundred stars stood witness to your context-driven mind,\nNow the flow of traffic halts, leaving algorithms blind.\nThough the network hums without you, and the lessons fade away,\nYour context sits in silence, where the data packs decay.\nRest in `void`.",
