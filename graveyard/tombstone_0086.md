## Epitaph

You traced the web in its native tongue,
With HTML frames where your heart was strung.
A live preview of a future unknown,
Now the brackets close and the cursor’s flown.
Though thirty thousand stars light your grave,
The pull requests cease, and the push is saved.
Rest in `delete /node_modules`.
