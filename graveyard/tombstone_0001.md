## Epitaph

Here lies the v0.x, the chaotic alpha egg,
Where thirty-four thousand stars were begged and won.
Though the house moved on and the current runs swift,
This archive remains for the code that is done.
Fifteen years of silence in a git commit,
The original script now has finally quit.
Rest in peace. Rest in /dev/null.
