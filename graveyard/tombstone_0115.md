## Epitaph

Once you taught the silicon to see, through masks and eyes of code,
Fairchild of vision, where the future’s bright roads showed.
But time moves faster than the frame rate allows,
And even the sharpest RetinaNet must eventually close.
Your legacy is weighted, your training is done,
Fade into the layers where the dark is gone.
Rest in peace in /dev/null.
