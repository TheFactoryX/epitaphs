## Epitaph

A glorious castle of `AFHTTPSessionManager`,
Built on the pillars of the old, strict tongue.
For thirty-three thousand stars, it was the standard-bearer,
Before the Swift winds blew and the new world was young.

The TLS handshake ceased, the socket closed tight,
And the "delightful" framework bowed to the weight of the years.
Here lies the monarch of the Objective-C night,
Rest in /dev/null.
