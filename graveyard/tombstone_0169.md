## Epitaph

You spanned the void for iOS and Android green,
A runtime bridge where native streams were seen.
Eight hundred days of silent transmission kept,
Before the signal faded, and the channel slept.
No longer shall the threads across the divide be sown,
Abandoned here, the sockets left alone.
Rest in /dev/null.
