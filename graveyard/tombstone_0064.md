## Epitaph

It rose from the browser, a T3-stack spark,
To gift a baby AGI to the dark.
With chains of LangChain and thoughts un-spun,
It chased the horizon of the autonomous sun.
But now the Next.js app has ceased to run,
The agent’s work is silently undone.
Deploy no more in this brave new world,
Rest in peace, `return null;`—auto-unfurled.
