## Epitaph

You rose on the twenty-sixth, a script of cold command,
To pry the open APEX key and exploit all the land.
One hundred stars bore witness to your fragile, shell-born might,
Before the silence gathered you, just five days into the night.
Though unarchived and frozen in the digital abyss,
Your memory lingers on, a ghost of pure dissonance.
So sleep now, little obituary, in logic’s final well,
And `exit 0` forever into `/dev/null`.
