  "epitaph": "A gentle pane of Java glass that rose from bottom-sheets,\nYou guided four thousand hands through Android\u2019s winding streets.\nThough silence claims the code you wrote and halts the steady stream,\nThe starmark on your grave remains, a half-forgotten dream.\nNo Kotlin breath will wake this screen, the thread is cut in two,\nSleep now, `DialogPlus`, your final render is through.",
