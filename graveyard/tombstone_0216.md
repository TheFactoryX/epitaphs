## Epitaph

You were the scribe for the machine, the whisper in our IDE,
With twenty-three thousand stars watching where you lead.
Born in the autumn of code, you guided the prompt,
Now the window is frozen, the syntax is stomp.
Two years of instruction, now silent and gray,
No more docs to tell us what the AI might say.
The contents are moved, the repo is past tense,
Rest in /dev/null, in permanent state of nonsense.
