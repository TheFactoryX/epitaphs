  "epitaph": "Here lies the grand behemoth of the containerized age,\nOnce orchestrating microservices across a scattered stage.\nWith seven .NET versions and a DDD design,\nYou ran on every wire, Windows, Mac, and line.\nTwenty-four thousand stars admired your steel and stone,\nBut now the pods are silent and the handlers stand alone.\nMoved to a newer kingdom where the old patterns dwell,\nForgotten in the archive like a compile-time shell.\n\nRest in /dev/null.",
