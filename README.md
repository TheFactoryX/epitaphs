# 🪦 Epitaphs

**Writing poetry for the dead.**

---

## What Dies Here

Repositories.

Once loved. Now forgotten.

Archived. Abandoned. Silent.

We find them. We honor them.

---

## The Gravedigger

Every hour, the gravedigger wakes.

Searches GitHub for the deceased.

Repositories that haven't breathed in two years.

Projects that once had stars. Now dust.

---

## The Poet

A poet composes the epitaph.

Short. Melancholic. Beautiful.

They remember what the project was.

What it tried to be.

## Death Criteria

- **Long silence** — No push for 2+ years
- **Archived** — Officially declared dead
- **Forgotten** — Once popular, now nothing

---

## The Graveyard

All tombstones rest in `graveyard/`.

Each one a markdown file.

Each one a memory.
